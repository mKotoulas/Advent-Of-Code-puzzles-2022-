# Advent Of Code puzzles 
Those puzzles are extremely popular but in case you haven't heard of the Aoc event you can find it here: https://adventofcode.com/

A series of 25 puzzles containing 2 parts each, posted one every day, from Dec 1 to Dec 25.

Tried this year's puzzles using Python3 and specifically Python3.6 but I am confident enough that all the code snippets will run with no problem if you use a newer version of Python to execute them. 

Also note that the problem statement for the second part of each puzzle is not available until you give the correct answer for the first one. If you just want to access part 2 run the code snippets for part one making sure you name your input file as input.txt. 

It is a wish of the creator of the event that people keep their personalized input private. Respecting that, i will not share my inputs in this repo. 

My intention is to work on visualizations of the puzzles and their solutions some time in the future, when I find some more free time. Some visualizations I have seen online are really an inspiration.
